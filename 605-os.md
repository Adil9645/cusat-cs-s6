Course Outcomes:
On completion of this course the student will be able to:
1. Familiarize with the basic concepts of operating systems.
2. Implement various process scheduling algorithms.
3. Design programs to avoid the synchronization problems.
4. Gain knowledge about memory management and virtual memory concepts.
5. Analyze various security and protection mechanisms in file system implementation.
6. Illustrate the problems related with deadlocks and deadlock handling.
7. Compare different types of operating systems.
