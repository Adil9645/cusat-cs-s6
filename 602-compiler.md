19-202-0602 COMPILER CONSTRUCTION
Course Outcomes:
On completion of this course the student will be able to:
1. Summarize the functionality of each phase involved in compilation process.
2. Develop scanner and parser using lex and yacc tools.
3. Design top down parsers including recursive descent parser and non-recursive predictive
parser for CFGs.
4. Design bottom up parsers including shift reduce, operator precedence and LR parsers (SLR,
CLR and LALR).
5. Explain Syntax directed translation using S-attributed definition and L-attributed definition.
6. Familiarize specification for a type checker and run time environment.
7. Comprehend different representations of intermediate code.
8. Describe various code optimization techniques to improve the performance of a program and
learn code generation techniques.
